.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from standard input and executes them.

.PP
.B Invocation
.PP
Interactive mode:
.PP
$ ./hsh
.PP
Non-interactive mode:
.PP
$ echo "command" | ./hsh

.PP
.B Command Execution
.PP
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken:

.PP
If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it. If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is invoked. If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If a match is found, that builtin is invoked.

.PP
If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no slashes, the shell searches each element of the PATH for a directory containing an executable file by that name.

.PP
If the search is successful, the program is invoked with the given arguments.

.SH BUILTINS
.PP
.B exit
.PP
Exit the shell.
.PP
.B env
.PP
Print the current environment variables.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
The exit status of an executed command is the value returned by the waitpid system call. A command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded. An exit status of zero indicates success. A non-zero exit status indicates failure.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
$ ./hsh
.PP
($) /bin/ls
